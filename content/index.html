    <p>Darling is a translation layer that lets you run macOS software on Linux</p>
</div>

<ul class="features">
    <li>
        <p class="heading"><i class="fas fa-fighter-jet"></i> Fast</p>
        <p>Darling runs macOS software directly without using a hardware emulator.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="heading"><i class="fab fa-github"></i> Free</p>
        <p>Like Linux, Darling is free and open-source software. <br/> It is developed openly on GitHub and distributed under the GNU GPL license version 3.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="heading"><i class="fas fa-cogs"></i> Compatible</p>
        <p>Darling implements a complete Darwin environment. Mach, dyld, launchd — everything you'd expect.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="heading"><i class="fas fa-check"></i> Easy to use</p>
        <p>Darling does most of the setup for you. Sit back and enjoy using your favorite software.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="heading"><i class="fab fa-linux"></i> Native</p>
        <p>We aim to fully integrate apps running under Darling into the Linux desktop experience by making them look, feel and behave just like native Linux apps.</p>

<ul class="faq">
    <li>
        <p class="heading">That sounds a lot like <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a> <i class="fas fa-wine-glass"></i></p> 
        <p>And it is! Wine lets you run Windows software on Linux, and Darling does the same for macOS software. Another similar project is <a href="https://anbox.io/">Anbox</a>, for Android apps.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="heading">Does it support GUI apps?</p> 
        <p>Almost! This took us a lot of time and effort, but we finally have basic experimental support for running <i>simple</i> graphical applications.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="heading">Does it violate Apple's EULA?</p> 
        <p>No! We only directly use those parts of Darwin that are released as fully free software.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="heading">Does the name Darling mean anything?</p> 
        <p>The name Darling is a combination of “Darwin” and “Linux”. Darwin is the core operating system macOS and iOS are based on.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="heading">Can I run Darling on Windows using WSL?</p> 
        <p>With WSL 2, yes! See <a href="https://docs.darlinghq.org/wsl-build.html">the documentation</a> for more details.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="heading">Do you know about <a href="https://opensource.apple.com/">opensource.apple.com</a>, GNUstep, The Cocotron and other projects?</p>
        <p>We do, and in fact, Darling is largely based on the original Darwin source code published by Apple. We use The Cocotron as a basis for our Cocoa implementation, along with the <a href="https://github.com/apportable/Foundation">Apportable Foundation</a> and various bits of GNUstep.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="heading">Do you have plans for supporting iOS apps?</p> 
        <p>Yes, in the long run, we'd like to be able to run iOS apps on ARM devices (like most Android phones). Come talk to us if you're interested in working on this!</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="heading">Which arcetextures of are supported?</p> 
        <p>Currently, x64 and x86 (64 and 32-bit Intel) macOS software is supported, with ARM64 support being in the works. In the future, we will support more archetexures. A Rosetta-like system may also be implemented.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="heading">How do I contribute?</p> 
        <p>Start by reading the <a href="https://docs.darlinghq.org">documentation</a> and <a href="http://blog.darlinghq.org">our blog</a> to get familiar with Darling internals. Then, come and join us <a href="https://github.com/darlinghq/darling">on GitHub</a>. It's great if you have experience in developing for macOS or iOS, but it's absolutely not required to start contributing.</p>
